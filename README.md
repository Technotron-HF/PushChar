This is my 2nd assembly program written for the Commodore 64 in kickassembler.
It is a Petscii editor for the C64.
The problem with this code is that the x y position of the arrow pointer doesn't correspond exactly to row col of the characters.
I need a routine that converts in the right way the x y position into row col position.
Before I can continue with this code I need to solve this problem.
You are welcome to collaborate to the project.
