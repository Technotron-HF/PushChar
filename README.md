This is my 2nd assembly program written for the Commodore 64 in kickassembler.
It is a Petscii editor for the C64.
The problem with this code is that the program cannot poke characters when the x>255.
Before I can continue with this code I need to solve this problem.
You are welcome to collaborate to the project.
