This is my 2nd assembly program written for the Commodore 64 in kickassembler.
It is a Petscii editor for the C64.
The program now recognizes the x y to row col correctly even when x>255.
Added the color screen. Now PushChar recognizes the colors.
Added load and save functions to the program.
You are welcome to collaborate to the project.
