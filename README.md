This is my 2nd assembly program written for the Commodore 64 in kickassembler.
It is a Petscii editor for the C64.
The program now recognizes the x y to row col correctly even when x>255.
Added the color screen. Now PushChar recognizes the colors.
Added load and save functions to the program.
Added copy char by pressing F5.
You are welcome to collaborate to the project.
